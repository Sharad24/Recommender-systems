# Recommender-systems

The repository has implementations for the following algorithms:
- User-user based Collaborative Filtering
- Item-item based Collaborative Filtering

Both algorithms work by predicting a rating for a particular user for a particular item. This is done by first initialising the CF class followed by calling KNN and then predict(). Then a ranking in decreading order would give us the item ids.

Here movies are used as items which are to be recommended.
